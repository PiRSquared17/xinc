#summary Xinc 2.1 feature candidates and release plan.

= Introduction =

After the big sleep, we will try to get new builds out, with fixes here and there. So we get a useable state of the source.
After the 2.1 release we will try to clean up the source base and add some new features into 2.2 release series.

For 3.0 we will add big new features, more clean up of code base, and switch to newer versions of some projects we depend on (Phing compatibility, ExtJS 4 and so on).

I know the schedule is very long term, I hope to get the releases out before planed.
