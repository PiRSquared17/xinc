 # (line 03) project @name Name of project.
 # (line 03) project @interval Subversion is polled every Interval number of seconds`*`.
 # (line 05) svn @directory Subversion project directory to poll for updates.
 # (line 07) builder @buildfile The main Phing build file for the project.
 # (line 08) builder @target The Phing build task that builds the project.
 # (line 07) builder @workingdirectory Optionally specify a working directory for the Phing builder (necessary if the Phing buildfile contains relative paths).
 # (line 10) This line specifies that the Phing target 'success' should be called in build.xml file if the build is successful.
 # (line 12) This line specifies that the Phing target 'failure' should be called in build.xml file if the build fails.
 # (line 14) The email publisher can be used to send emails dependent on the success or failure of the build.

_`*`If the interval for a project is negative, Xinc will enter 'run-once mode': it will check the project a single time, act on any changes detected, and then exit._
