#summary Xinc 2.0 feature candidates and release plan.

= Introduction =

The following release plan has some major IFs attached to it, because the development depends on very few people at the moment. Therefore it is very rough and cannot give you exact dates for milestones.

The feature candidates have a priority attached in which they are developed.
Priority 1 is the highest down to Priority 3.
