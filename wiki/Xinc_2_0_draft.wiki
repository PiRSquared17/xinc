#summary Architectural change towards a more flexible plugin-system

= Introduction =

Version 2.0 of Xinc will mainly focus on an architectural change.
Xinc will be using a *Plugin-Architecture*, which will allow for faster evolution and broader community-support.

= Build-Process =

The build-process will be defined by the following Slots:
  * *PRE_PROCESS*: for example: Place to put modification-sets 
  * *PROCESS*: for example: Place to put builders
  * *POST_PROCESS*: for example: Place to put publishers

= Plugin-Architecture =

Plugins will be able to:
  * define tasks (similar to taskdef in ant)
  * define subtasks as children of a kind of "task-group"
  * define Listeners
  * plug into one of the above defined slots
  * stop the build-process
  * continue the build-process
